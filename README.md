> A pure Ruby library that provides a set of methods for processing keyboard input in character, line and multiline modes. It maintains history of entered input with an ability to recall and re-edit those inputs. It lets you register to listen for keystroke events and trigger custom key events yourself.

**TTY::Reader** provides independent reader component for [TTY](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty) toolkit.

## Compatibility

The `tty-reader` is not compatible with the GNU Readline and doesn't aim to be. It originated from [tty-prompt](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt) project to provide flexibility, independence from underlying operating system and Ruby like API interface for creating different prompts.

`TTY::Reader` forges its own path to provide features necessary for building line editing in terminal applications!

## Features

* Pure Ruby
* Reading [single keypress](#21-read_keypress)
* [Line editing](#22-read_line)
* Reading [multiline input](#23-read_multiline)
* Ability to [register](#24-on) for keystroke events
* Track input [history](#32-track_history)
* No global state
* Works on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows
* Supports Ruby versions `>= 2.0.0` & JRuby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tty-reader"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tty-reader

  * [3.6 :history_size](#36-history_size)

## Usage

In just a few lines you can recreate IRB prompt.

Initialize the reader:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new
```

Then register to listen for key events, in this case listen for `Ctrl-X` or `Esc` keys to exit:

```ruby
reader.on(:keyctrl_x, :keyescape) do
  puts "Exiting..."
  exit
end
```

Finally, keep asking user for line input with a `=>` as a prompt:

```ruby
loop do
  reader.read_line("=> ")
end
```

## API

### 2.1 read_keypress

To read a single key stroke from the user use `read_char` or `read_keypress`:

```ruby
reader.read_char
reader.read_keypress
reader.read_keypress(nonblock: true)
```

### 2.2 read_line

By default `read_line` works in `raw mode` which means it behaves like a line editor that allows you to edit each character, respond to `control characters` such as `Control-A` to `Control-B` or navigate through history.

For example, to read a single line terminated by a new line character use `read_line` like so:

```ruby
reader.read_line
```

If you wish for the keystrokes to be interpreted by the terminal instead, use so called `cooked` mode by providing the `:raw` option set to `false`:

```ruby
reader.read_line(raw: false)
```

Any non-interpreted characters received are written back to terminal, however you can stop this by using `:echo` option set to `false`:

```ruby
reader.read_line(echo: false)
```

You can also provide a line prefix displayed before input by passing it as a first argument:

```ruby
reader.read_line(">> ")
# >>
```

To pre-populate the line content for editing use `:value` option:

```ruby
reader.read_line("> ", value: "edit me")
# > edit me
```

### 2.3 read_multiline

By default `read_multiline` works in `raw mode` which means it behaves like a multiline editor that allows you to edit each character, respond to `control characters` such as `Control-A` to `Control-B` or navigate through history.

For example, to read more than one line terminated by `Ctrl+d` or `Ctrl+z` use `read_multiline`:

```ruby
reader.read_multiline
# => [ "line1", "line2", ... ]
```

If you wish for the keystrokes to be interpreted by the terminal instead, use so called `cooked` mode by providing the `:raw` option set to `false`:

```ruby
reader.read_line(raw: false)
```

You can also provide a line prefix displayed before input by passing a string as a first argument:

```ruby
reader.read_multiline(">> ")
```

### 2.4 on

You can register to listen on a key pressed events. This can be done by calling `on` with a event name(s):

```ruby
reader.on(:keypress) { |event| .... }
```

or listen for multiple events:

```ruby
reader.on(:keyctrl_x, :keyescape) { |event| ... }
```

The `KeyEvent` object is yielded to a block whenever a particular key event fires. The event responds to:

* `key`   - key pressed
* `value` - value of the key pressed
* `line`  - the `Line` object of the currently edited line, nil otherwise

The `value` returns the actual key pressed and the `line` the content for the currently edited line or is empty.

The `key` is an object that responds to following messages:

* `name`  - the name of the event such as :up, :down, letter or digit
* `meta`  - true if event is non-standard key associated
* `shift` - true if shift has been pressed with the key
* `ctrl`  - true if ctrl has been pressed with the key

For example, to add listen to vim like navigation keys, one would do the following:

```ruby
reader.on(:keypress) do |event|
  if event.value == "j"
    ...
  end

  if event.value == "k"
    ...
  end
end
```

You can subscribe to more than one event:

```ruby
reader.on(:keypress) { |event| ... }
      .on(:keydown)  { |event| ... }
```

### 2.5 subscribe

You can subscribe any object to listen for the emitted [key events](#27-supported-events) using the `subscribe` message. The listener would need to implement a method for every event it wishes to receive.

For example, if a `MyListener` class wishes to only listen for `keypress` event:

```ruby
class MyListener
  def keypress(event)
    ...
  end
end
```

Then subscribing is done:

```ruby
reader.subscribe(MyListener.new)
```

Alternatively, `subscribe` allows you to listen to events only for the duration of block execution like so:

```ruby
reader.subscribe(MyListener) do
  ...
end
```

### 2.6 unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe any object from listening to the key events using the `unsubscribe` message:

```ruby
reader.unsubscribe(my_listener)
```

### 2.7 trigger

The signature for triggering key events is `trigger(event, args...)`. The first argument is a [key event name](#27-supported-events) followed by any number of actual values related to the event being triggered.

For example, to trigger `:keydown` event do:

```ruby
reader.trigger(:keydown)
```

To add vim bindings for line editing you could discern between alphanumeric inputs like so:

```ruby
reader.on(:keypress) do |event|
  if event.value == "j"
    reader.trigger(:keydown)
  end
  if evevnt.value == "k"
    reader.trigger(:keyup)
  end
end
```

### 2.8 supported events

The available key events for character input are:

* `:keypress`
* `:keyenter`
* `:keyreturn`
* `:keytab`
* `:keybackspace`
* `:keyspace`
* `:keyescape`
* `:keydelete`
* `:keyalpha`
* `:keynum`

The navigation related key events are:

* `:keydown`
* `:keyup`
* `:keyleft`
* `:keyright`
* `:keyhome`
* `:keyend`
* `:keyclear`

The specific `ctrl` key events:

* `:keyctrl_a`
* `:keyctrl_b`
* ...
* `:keyctrl_z`

The key events for functional keys `f*` are:

* `:keyf1`
* `:keyf2`
* ...
* `:keyf24`

## 3. Configuration

### 3.1. `:interrupt`

By default `InputInterrupt` error will be raised when the user hits the interrupt key(Control-C). However, you can customise this behaviour by passing the `:interrupt` option. The available options are:

* `:signal` - sends interrupt signal
* `:exit` - exists with status code
* `:noop` - skips handler
* custom proc

For example, to send interrupt signal do:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(interrupt: :signal)
```

### 3.2. `:track_history`

The `read_line` and `read_multiline` provide history buffer that tracks all the lines entered during `TTY::Reader.new` interactions. The history buffer provides previous or next lines when user presses up/down arrows respectively. However, if you wish to disable this behaviour use `:track_history` option like so:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(track_history: false)
```

### 3.3. `:history_cycle`

This option determines whether the history buffer allows for infinite navigation. By default it is set to `false`. You can change this:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(history_cycle: true)
```

### 3.4. `:history_duplicates`

This option controls whether duplicate lines are stored in history. By default set to `true`. You can change this:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(history_duplicates: false)
```

### 3.5. `:history_exclude`

This option allows you to exclude lines from being stored in history. It accepts a `Proc` with a line as a first argument. By default it is set to exclude empty lines. To change this:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(history_exclude: ->(line) { ... })
```

### 3.6. `:history_size`

By default, the history buffer can store up to `512` lines. This can be changed with the `:history_size` configuration:

```ruby
reader = TTY::Reader.new(history_size: 2048)
```
